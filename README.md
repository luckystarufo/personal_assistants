## Personal Assistants — AI Agents

This repository contains a collection of AI agents built for my personal workflows. It is not designed for universal, one-size-fits-all use. I update it occasionally as new needs arise and time permits.

### Tech stack
- Python (primary language)
- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Playwright for browser automation

### Contributing and reuse
